""" index of character in string 

find() vs index() 

There are two string methods for this, find() and index(). The difference between

""" "method may be static" warning

and if you value zero warnings, you can make this one go away two different ways:

Workaround #1

Workaround #2 [Thanks @DavidPÃ¤rsson]
